## 🚀 About Me

- 👨‍💻 I’m Mihretab, a junior full-stack developer who codes with curiosity and a big smile.
- 🦾 My toolkit? **Golang** for backend wizardry, **Svelte** for slick UIs, and a love for learning that knows no bounds.
- 🌱 “Interested in everything” is my motto! If it’s new, shiny, or challenging, you’ll find me there.
- 🤝 Collaboration is my jam—let’s build something cool together!
